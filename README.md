# Intro to Web Development
#### Forest Hill High School > Mr. James  
### Resources
- Go to [jsfiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net)   
In the HTML square type Hello World, then click the Run button.  
You should see the output in the bottom right box.  
Use jsfiddle for all our HTML exercises.  
- Go to [the GitHub html folder](http://www.github.com/joeyajames/jps/html) to find a bunch of different HTML starter code.  
You can copy and paste these into the jsfiddle HTML box one at a time, or retype them.  
You should get output in the bottom right box.  
- See detailed documentation on each HTML tag at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).  
W3schools has comprehensive explanations of all HTML tags.  
### Instructions
- Open a jsfiddle window and the html folder in separate tabs in your browser.
- Copy and paste the HTML code from each of the HTML files into the jsfiddle and run it.  
Try modifying the code to see how the output changes. Add an extra block of text, or an extra form field. Put your own message in.  
- After you get familiar with each of the files in the html folder, try building up your own personal webpage, similar to mine.  
Add images you find on the web (you just need the image url to put the image into your webpage).  
Put things you like on your homepage.
